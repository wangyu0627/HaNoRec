# HaNoRec
Multimodal Large Language Models with Adaptive Preference Optimization for Sequential Recommendation

# Weâ€™re working on releasing the code soon â€” Please stay tuned!

## ðŸ’¡ Dataset Structure and Download

You can download multimodal recommendation files in the following datasets:

**Microlens**/ **Netflix**/ **Movielens** [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hYlIN6qt7vnzCd4ZwBSFkvMBeqo63d4b/view)

Each dataset consists of a training set, a validation set, and a test set. During the training process, we utilize the validation set to determine when to stop the training in order to prevent overfitting.
